# Cars-Central
This is a website designed to sell cars. People can create an account, post their cars for sell, include pictures they can upload from their device. Once they make a post, everyone else who has an account can see it and send them a notification with their email letting them know that they are interested. I used python for the backend of the project and used Django framework.
